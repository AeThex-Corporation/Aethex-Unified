The "AeThex Companion" Mobile App
Objective: Build a React Native (Expo) mobile application called the "AeThex Companion." This is a "Super-App" that changes its entire UI/UX based on the user's role.

Tech Stack:

Framework: React Native (Expo) with TypeScript.

Navigation: Expo Router (File-based routing).

Styling: NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native).

State Management: Zustand (for handling the "Day/Night" mode switch).

Icons: Lucide React Native.

Core Architecture: The "Mode" System The app has two distinct "Modes" (Themes & Layouts) controlled by a global state (useAppStore).

Day Mode (Enterprise):

Target: School Admins/Business Owners.

Theme: Clean White background (#ffffff), Deep Blue accents (#1e3a8a), Inter font.

Tabs: Home (Alerts), Scan (Camera), Actions (Approvals), Profile.

Night Mode (Creator):

Target: Developers/Artists.

Theme: Deep Black background (#0B0A0F), Neon Green accents (#22c55e), Monospace font.

Tabs: Feed (Bounties), Wallet (ID Card), Guild (Chat), Profile.

Feature Requirements (Mock Data Only for MVP):

Authentication Screen:

A login screen with a "Sign in with AeThex Passport" button.

Mock Login Logic:

If username is admin, log in as Day Mode.

If username is creator, log in as Night Mode.

Screen 1: The "Home/Feed" (Dual Interface)

If Day Mode: Show a "Compliance Dashboard." Cards for "PII Incidents Blocked," "Active Students," and "System Health."

If Night Mode: Show a "Bounty Feed." Cards for "New Job: Synthwave Track ($500)," "GameForge Sprint Update."

Screen 2: The "Scanner/Wallet" (Dual Interface)

If Day Mode (Scanner): Open a camera view (mocked) to "Scan Receipt." Show a list of "Recent Expenses."

If Night Mode (Wallet): Show a beautiful, animated "Digital ID Card" with a QR code and "Verified Architect" badge.

Screen 3: Profile & Settings (The Toggle)

Display user info (Avatar, Name, Role).

The Magic Toggle: Add a button: "Switch View."

Logic: Clicking this toggles the global state between Day and Night mode, instantly changing the theme colors, fonts, and bottom tab navigation.

Implementation Steps:

Set up the Expo Router structure (app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx).

Create the useAppStore (Zustand) to hold mode: 'day' | 'night'.

Create a ThemeContext or helper to swap colors based on the store.

Build the screens with conditional rendering based on the mode.

Ensure the "Switch View" button creates a smooth transition between the two worlds.

Action: Generate the full project code, starting with the store, the layout, and the main screens.
